I am trying to recover old Prodigy. THIS IS NOT GAME PIRACY definition of game piracy is "Video game piracy refers to the illegal copying, distribution, and use of video games. This can include several forms, such as: Unauthorised Copying: Making copies of games without permission from the rights holders. This is often done by duplicating the game's files onto other media, like CDs, DVDs, or USB drives."
